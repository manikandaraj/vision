How to Invalidate Cloud Front Cache through CLI,

* You need to have awscli installed and added to your $PATH, for the aws commands to work
* You need to have the ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials setup in your home directory.
* You need to have jq util, which makes it easy for looking into your Distribution details response.

Get the List of Distributions for your account,
	aws cloudfront list-distributions > AWS_CloudFront_Distribution_List.json

Let's just say this is your Cloudfront URL,
	http://dmf4bfelyx33v.cloudfront.net/images/headerlogos/header1.bmp
then your domain is - 'dmf4bfelyx33v'

Get the Distribution ID from the List, giving the domain name,
	cat AWS_CloudFront_Distribution_List.json | jq -r '.DistributionList.Items[] | select(.DomainName | test("dmf4bfelyx33v*")) | .Id'

Invalidate the Cache by using the below command, 
	aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E4S45NPHIMFNS1 --paths /images/headerlogos/header1.bmp
